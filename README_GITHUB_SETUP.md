# 🚀 GitHub Setup - Almost Automatic!

I've set everything up for you. Here's what to do:

## ✅ What I've Done

1. ✅ Configured git remote: `https://github.com/JayeshVelivela/multi-tenant-document-processing-platform.git`
2. ✅ Created auto-push script
3. ✅ Opened GitHub repo creation page in your browser

## 📋 What You Need to Do (30 seconds)

**The browser should have opened to GitHub. If not, go to:**
https://github.com/new

**Then:**
1. Repository name should be pre-filled: `multi-tenant-document-processing-platform`
2. Make it **Public** (for free hosting) or **Private**
3. **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT check any boxes (no README, .gitignore, or license)
4. Click **"Create repository"**

## 🚀 After Creating the Repository

**Option 1: Run the auto-push script** (I'll do it for you):
```bash
./auto_push.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual push**:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## ✨ That's It!

Once pushed, your code will be on GitHub at:
**https://github.com/JayeshVelivela/multi-tenant-document-processing-platform**

Then you can deploy using the instructions in `QUICK_DEPLOY.md`!

---

**Note**: If you need to create the repo manually, the auto-push script will detect it and push automatically.
